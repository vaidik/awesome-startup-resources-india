# awesome-startup-resources-india

Every startup founder or technology leader I talk to needs help with various
problems that are common across companies but are unique in the context of India
or have unique solutions in India. Startup founders and technology leaders
constantly seek help for these common problems over and over again in forums,
communities and personal networks. I thought it might be a good idea to put
together an index of helpful resources for Indian tech startups and make these
resources available to a larger audience.

## Contributing

While I have initiated this project, I am looking for experts to contribute to
this guide to make it more useful for a larger audience. Having said that, I
don't want it to become a place where every vendor just comes and puts their
name for advertising. So I do intend to do gatekeeping and perhaps eventually
have a system for gatekeeping that is not blocked on me.

If you want to contribute please don't hesitate but also don't try to use this
as a medium to advertise. Just send a pull request following the guidelines in
the pull request template. I promise I will review and discuss to make sure
contribution gets the due attention.

It is alright if you need help with something that is not covered in this guide.
Just create an issue on what you need help with. If it is in the common interest
of the community and if I have information available readily, I will add it to
the index. But even if I don't have any way to help, may be someone can help and
curate resources in the future.
